Michaelis-Menten kinetics of TLL
_______________________________

TLL activity was measured at different concentrations of the pre-fluorescent substrate CFDA at pH 7.9 and 9.0, respectively.

Substrate concentrations are 1.5, 4.7, 15, 47 and 150 uM.

Product concentrations for the calibration curve are 10 pM, 100 pM, 1 nM, 10 nM, 50 nM and 100 nM.

_______________________________

NB. Activity measurements at pH 9.0 [CFDA]=47 uM are outliers probably due to a pipetting error? Outliers should be removed from the final analysis. Remember to comment on this in the report.
